## Code of Conduct

You're welcome to our house in good faith – read our [code of conduct](https://www.notion.so/libscie/Code-of-Conduct-580ab64832a2478fad7d9dfad9d3da15) for the house rules applicable to all contributions.

These house rules exist to grow a community that respects personal boundaries, differences, and recognizes privilege. Please make the effort to listen when somebody makes the effort to provide you with feedback, also when it is difficult to hear or understand. Good intent does not excuse behavior in violation of these house rules ([read more about why here](https://thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)).

Our house may be different from yours, and if you find any of this unagreeable, that's perfectly okay, and we ask you respectfully to not contribute.

## Development

Please clone the repository and make sure you have [BlitzJS](blitzjs.com/) installed

```
git clone https://github.com/libscie/researchequals.com
npm install -g blitz --legacy-peer-deps
```

All pull requests are automatically deployed using Heroku (self-destroyed after 24 hours).

We will be adding a more extensive contributing document shortly.
