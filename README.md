[ResearchEquals.com](https://researchequals.com) is a research module server, where researchers can publish building blocks of research and link them together in chronological order.

If you'd like to test the latest feature implementations, you can do so on our [staging version](https://researchequals-staging.herokuapp.com/). Please note that information there can be deleted at any time.

## Code of Conduct

You're welcome to our house in good faith – read our [code of conduct](https://www.notion.so/libscie/Code-of-Conduct-580ab64832a2478fad7d9dfad9d3da15) for the house rules applicable to all contributions. Good intent does not excuse behavior in violation of these house rules ([read more about why here](https://thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)).

Our house may be different from yours, and if you find any of this unagreeable, that's perfectly okay, and we ask you respectfully to not contribute.

## Development

```

All pull requests are automatically deployed using Heroku (self-destroyed after 24 hours).
