# Security Policy

We do our best to keep ResearchEquals secure. We recognize that this is an ongoing effort and appreciate community participation.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate any reports on how we may improve our security. Please send us a detailed report at [security@libscie.org](mailto:security@libscie.org). Please include `[R= security event]` in the subject so we now it has high priority ⏰

We understand it can be frustrating if you don't hear from us. We try to respond within 48 hours on business working days. We do not have security experts on our small team (1 person full-time), so please understand we're trying our best.

Any expertise you might share with us on how to improve our project, is very welcome. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Recommendations for our reporting procedure (this document)
* General, contained improvements to the codebase (please discuss with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SefsGJWWSw))
* Discuss security with us in [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/SefsGJWWSw)
