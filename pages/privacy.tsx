### 3. Registration on the Platform

To use the publishing functions of our platform you have to register with us. During registration, we will ask you for an email address, a name of your initial workspace and a password. We will use your email address to send you a confirmation email to validate your address and account. If you do not validate your email address, your account will be deleted after 30 days. If you validate your email address, your account will be active until you delete it by using the functions of the platform. The legal basis for the processing described above is Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b) GDPR.

### 4. Functions of the Platform

On our platform we provide you with the necessary tools to publish content under cer-tain open access licenses.

We base any processing that is required to provide you with the functions of the platform or other services ac-cording to our terms of services on Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b) GDPR.

#### a) Publishing Content in general

We will process any of the information you provide to us – including meta information of the content and information about co-authors – to provide you with the functions of the platform and enable you to publish your works. If you publish a work, we will make it accessible on the platform under the chosen license. The content and the related information form a scientific work for which you granted us certain rights. We will keep the content and the related information on the platform even if you may close your account. Deletion of the content is only possible under rare and exceptional circumstances.

We will only access the account information you explicitly grant us access to and we will not be able to see your log in credentials.

We may analyse the uploaded content to gain more insights into the research on the platform, our users or our services and use these insights to improve our service or general research purposes.
